In web development it's safe to say that the biggest player are Functional programming and Object-oriented programming, with the first getting more prominence in the current days, at least in the front-end side.</p><p>It is important to understand both, but we will take the Functional Programming route to dive deeper in this Guide. Do not stop yourself from going further and studying Object-oriented programming as well!</p><p>This Guide's deliverable is an article, which you will write and share.
