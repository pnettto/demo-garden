For example, it's very natural to log-in to a completely new system using your Facebook or Github account, or to show Instagram pictures in a website, or to save data in an external CMS such as Prismic that will then offer that same data in a nice format for our applications to display. These are just a few examples, not to mention that our own systems are, more often than not, composed of an internal API server and a front-end side.</p><p>In this Guide you will explore this fundamental subject to becoming a professional web developer.</p>","Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is JSON"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is the client-server architecture"},{"Knowledge":"Understand the concept of Promises"}],"Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to use JSON to transport data across different systems"},{"Skill":"Be able to use the fetch API in Javascript"},{"Skill":"Be able to use Promises in Javascript"},{"Skill":"Be able to use Async functions in Javascript"},{"Skill":"Be able to debug Javascript code using both the console and VSCode (or similar)"}],"topicsList":"<ul><li>JSON<ul><li>What is JSON?</li><li>Parse / Stringify</li></ul></li><li>Client-server architecture</li><li>Fetch API</li><li>ES6 Promises &amp; Async-Await<ul><li>Resolving</li><li>Waiting for wall Promises</li><li>Error handling</li></ul></li><li>Error handling / try...catch...finally</li><li>Debugging<ul><li>console.log</li><li>Browser debuggers</li></ul></li></ul>","actionPoints":[{"actionPoint":"Discover what JSON is and how to parse/stringify in Javascript"},{"actionPoint":"Watch a video on client-server architecture to get the basics of it"},{"actionPoint":"Learn the fetch API in Javascript (pro tip: make use of Mockaroo to create endpoints)"},{"actionPoint":"Find out how to use Promises in Javascript"},{"actionPoint":"Learn what are Async functions in Javascript"},{"actionPoint":"Learn how to use try/catch blocks in Javascript"},{"actionPoint":"Learn how to use a debugger in VSCode (or similar) to debug your websites"}],"Deliver":{"Title":"API-centered application","Description":"<ul><li>Submit:<ul><li>Glitch Project URL or Github Repository + Github Pages URLs<ul><li>Add comments for each relevant code block</li></ul></li><li>Project description and details in the README.md file</li></ul></li><li>Minimum requirements<ul><li>Create an application that consumes and uses data from a API using<ul><li>Fetch API</li><li>Async-Await</li><li>try...catch for error handling</li></ul></li><li>Application should have at least one interaction point involving the API (see more, filter results, etc)</li></ul></li><li>Theme ideas:<ul><li>Weather app (choose place or find out via Geolocation API)</li><li>Use your own API created at <a href=\"https://www.mockaroo.com/\">https://www.mockaroo.com/</a> or <a href=\"https://airtable.com/\">https://airtable.com/</a></li><li>Data visualization app (check D3.js)</li><li>Google something like “public apis for testing” to find lists such as <a href=\"https://dev.to/camerenisonfire/10-intriguing-public-rest-apis-for-your-next-project-2gbd\">https://dev.to/camerenisonfire/10-intriguing-public-rest-apis-for-your-next-project-2gbd </a>, <a href=\"https://any-api.com/\">https://any-api.com </a>and <a href=\"https://dev.to/nialljoemaher/10-fun-api-s-to-inspire-your-next-project-3224?utm_source=digest_mailer&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=digest_email\">https://dev.to/nialljoemaher/10-fun-api-s-to-inspire-your-next-project-3224</a></li></ul></li></ul>"},"Classes":[],"Resources":[],"project":{"UID":"4-connecting-to-the-world","Title":"4 -
