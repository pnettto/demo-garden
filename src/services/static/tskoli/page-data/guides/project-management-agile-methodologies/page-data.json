Traditionally, a software project was centralized in the Project Manager, a professional specialized in creating a plan and orchestrating a team to execute it. But, more often than not, this process proved inadequate to the software industry due to the long cycles of development and problems that arose from not trying out the features more quickly.</p><p>From this context, teams increasingly adopted Agile Development Methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban, which count on short development iterations (i.e. shipping code &nbsp;often). In this Guide you will learn about these methodologies and how they can help out on the group works during the course and in your professional career.</p>","Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is project management"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is Agile Development"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is Scrum and its components"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is Kanban and its components"}],"Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to write an article"}],"topicsList":"<ul><li>Traditional/Waterfall vs Agile</li><li>Scrum<ul><li>Roles<ul><li>Product Owner<ul><li>Product Backlog</li></ul></li><li>Scrum master</li><li>Team</li></ul></li><li>Ceremonies<ul><li>Sprint planning<ul><li>Sprint Backlog</li><li>User Stories<ul><li>Points</li><li>Velocity</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Daily Scrum<ul><li>Stand-up meeting</li><li>Burn-down Charts</li></ul></li><li>Retro tools<ul><li>Conflict resolution</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Definition of done</li></ul></li><li>Kanban<ul><li>Kanban board</li><li>Kanban cards</li><li>Work-in-progress (WIP) limits</li></ul></li></ul>","actionPoints":[{"actionPoint":"Read-up on Project Management in Software Development as a whole"},{"actionPoint":"Learn about Scrum and Kanban, making sure to understand all topics listed in the Guide"}],"Deliver":{"Title":"Technical Article","Description":"<ul><li>Submit:<ul><li>Article’s public URL</li></ul></li><li>Minimum requirements:&nbsp;<ul><li>Technical article about Agile Development</li><li>Possible to pick a specific topic to talk about in details instead of something more generic</li></ul></li></ul>"},"Classes":[],"Resources":[],"project":{"UID":"1-introductory-course","Title":"1 -
