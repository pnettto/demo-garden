In modern times, though, the web development ecosystem became a lot more powerful but also a lot more complicated and everything has many (like, many) dependencies. That is why we need to use <strong>package managers</strong> such as <strong>npm</strong> or <strong>yarn</strong>.</p><p>In this Guide you will explore these softwares to learn how they can help your workflow.</p>","Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a package manager"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what a dependency is"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what a bundler is"}],"Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to use a package manager such as npm"},{"Skill":"Be able to bundle a code base"}],"topicsList":"<ul><li>ES6 Modules<ul><li>Import / Export</li></ul></li><li>Package Managers<ul><li>NPM &amp;
