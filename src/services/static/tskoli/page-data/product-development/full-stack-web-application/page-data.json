This makes sense because it often makes for an easier separation of roles and a more productive team.&nbsp;</p><p>But being completely alienated from what makes up the back-end can also mean a front-end developer only sees a part of the picture they are trying to paint. Which is why in this Product Development Guide the students should create a back-end application from scratch and connect it to a (now familiar) front-end application.</p><p>The group must produce a written description of a product (briefing) which fits in this Guide’s requirements, and proceed to develop that product. The product can be fictitious or real, meaning the beneficiary can be the students or an external institution. Some theme ideas are listed in this Guide but do not represent, by any means, subject boundaries. The students are encouraged to use their imagination and networking to find interesting project ideas to work on and exercise the web development skills related to this Guide.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Group arrangement</strong></p><p>Students must assemble in groups of 3-4.</p><p><strong>Minimum requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Use Agile Development techniques (e.g. Scrum, Kanban, pair programming)</li><li>Creation of a back-end system which should:<ul><li>Connect to a database</li><li>Do all CRUD operations</li><li>Expose an API so that front-end systems can use it</li></ul></li><li>Creation of a Web Application, which should:<ul><li>Consume the API created in the back-end</li><li>Count on an original design (i.e. created by the group)</li><li>Front-end can be on the simpler side</li></ul></li><li>Final product must be available online (no need for a paid domain)</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Deliverables</strong></p><ul><li>Link to project briefing</li><li>Link to design files</li><li>Link to repository containing the back-end code</li><li>Link to repository containing the front-end code</li><li>Link to access the project online</li><li>Group presentation about final result</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Theme ideas</strong></p><ul><li>A lightweight CMS system (back-end) with an administration interface (front-end)</li><li>A streaming service</li><li>IFTTT-like application</li><li>URL-shortener with multiple options</li></ul>"}],"project":{"UID":"6-back-end-and-infrastructure","Title":"6 - Back-end & Infrastructure","guides":[{"Title":"Back-end - Operating Systems","UID":"back-end-operating-systems","Skills":[],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand the general aspects of how an Operating System works"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Back-end - Linux","UID":"back-end-linux","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to navigate a Linux system"},{"Skill":"Be able to create, edit and remove files in a Linux system"},{"Skill":"Be able to execute commands in a Linux system"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand the general aspects of how Linux works"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Back-end - Docker","UID":"back-end-docker","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to use the basics of Docker"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is virtualization"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is Containerization"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is Docker"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Back-end - Security","UID":"back-end-security","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to write a technical article"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand the main concepts around security for web applications"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Back-end - Server-side Javascript","UID":"back-end-server-side-javascript","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to create a NodeJS application"},{"Skill":"Be able to create an API with NodeJS"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is NodeJS"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Back-end - MongoDB (NoSQL) & Mailers","UID":"back-end-mongodb-nosql-and-mailers","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to create an application using a NoSQL database"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is are the CRUD operations"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is NoSQL and MongoDB"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Back-end - DevOps","UID":"back-end-dev-ops","Skills":[],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what are DevOps"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is Continuous Integration"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what are Web Hooks"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Back-end - Python & Flask","UID":"back-end-python-and-flask","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to create an API using Python and Flask"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is Python"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is Flask"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a RESTful API"}],"Category":"code"}],"product_development":{"UID":"full-stack-web-application","Title":"Full stack web application","Competences":[{"Competence":"To be ready to collaborate effectively with peers in order to achieve a common goal"},{"Competence":"To be ready to learn and apply new technologies independently"},{"Competence":"To be ready to exhibit the results of a collaborative work"},{"Competence":"To be ready to create and deliver professional-grade web applications"},{"Competence":"To be ready to communicate and work independent of the technology stack involved"}]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3604364457","3649515864","63159454"]}
