They should do so while being able to use a great UI/UX strategy which supports the functionalities.</p><p>Creating such an application from scratch is no easy task. Therefore, tools such as frameworks must be used to develop the final product which, by the way, does not have to live in the browser. Tools such React Native, Electron, Arduino, Gastby and Next.js can and should be incorporated into the workflow, as needed.</p><p>The group must produce a written description of a product (briefing) which fits in this Guide’s requirements, and proceed to develop that product. The product can be fictitious or real, meaning the beneficiary can be the students or an external institution. Some theme ideas are listed in this Guide but do not represent, by any means, subject boundaries. The students are encouraged to use their imagination and networking to find interesting project ideas to work on and exercise the web development skills related to this Guide.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Group arrangement</strong></p><p>Students must assemble in groups of 3-4.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Minimum requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Use Agile Development techniques (e.g. Scrum, Kanban, pair programming)</li><li>Creation of an original design (i.e. created by the group)<ul><li>The application must be responsive</li></ul></li><li>Creation of a Web Application, which should:<ul><li>Make use of a framework that helps creating complex and efficient applications such as React, GastbyJS, Next.js, React Native and Electron</li><li>Allow for account creation (authentication)</li><li>Persist (and secure) users’ data</li><li>Allow for sharing relevant information</li></ul></li><li>Final product must be available online (no need for a paid domain)</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Deliverables</strong></p><ul><li>Link to project briefing</li><li>Link to design files for all pages (include responsiveness)</li><li>Link to style guide</li><li>Link to repository containing the project’s code</li><li>Link to access the project online</li><li>Group presentation about final result</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Theme ideas</strong></p><ul><li>An e-commerce platform</li><li>A social media platform</li><li>A trade platform</li><li>A long-term flat rental platform for Reykjavík</li><li>A system to improve citizens’ collaboration with the City Hall</li></ul>"}],"project":{"UID":"5-growing-complexity","Title":"5 - Growing complexity","guides":[{"Title":"Javascript - Internals","UID":"javascript-internals","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to write a technical article"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is the Javascript Event Loops"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is prototypal inheritance in Javascript"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Javascript/React - SPAs","UID":"javascript-react-spas","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to create a SPA with React"},{"Skill":"Be able to use an authentication mechanism in React"},{"Skill":"Be able to use a database in React"},{"Skill":"Be able to use a state management tool"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a Single Page Application"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a Router in Javascript"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is Authentication"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a database"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Javascript/React - SSR & Performance","UID":"javascript-react-ssr-and-performance","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to create a static site with React"},{"Skill":"Be able to use GraphQL to query data"},{"Skill":"Be able to create a Progresssive Web App"},{"Skill":"Be able to run performance checks and act on the results"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is Server-Side Rendering"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is GraphQL"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a Progressive Web App (PWA)"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Javascript Beyond the Browser - Reactive Native","UID":"javascript-beyond-the-browser-reactive-native","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to use React Native to create a mobile app"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a mobile application framework"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is React Native"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Javascript Beyond the Browser - Electron","UID":"javascript-electron","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to create a Desktop application with Javascript"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is ElectronJS"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Design - Web Design Trends","UID":"design-web-design-trends","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to do market research related to web design"}],"Knowledge":[],"Category":"design"}],"product_development":{"UID":"a-complex-web-application","Title":"A Complex Web Application","Competences":[{"Competence":"To be ready to collaborate effectively with peers in order to achieve a common goal"},{"Competence":"To be ready to learn and apply new technologies independently"},{"Competence":"To be ready to exhibit the results of a collaborative work"},{"Competence":"To be ready to create and deliver professional-grade web applications"}]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3604364457","3649515864","63159454"]}
