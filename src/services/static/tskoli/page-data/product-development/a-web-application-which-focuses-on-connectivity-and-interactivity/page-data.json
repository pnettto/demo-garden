There are currently many tools, such as React, which help developers be much more productive when creating interactive interfaces. The students should make use of such tools during this work.</p><p>The group must produce a written description of a product (briefing) which fits in this Guide’s requirements, and proceed to develop that product. The product can be fictitious or real, meaning the beneficiary can be the students or an external institution. Some theme ideas are listed in this Guide but do not represent, by any means, subject boundaries. The students are encouraged to use their imagination and networking to find interesting project ideas to work on and exercise the web development skills related to this Guide.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Group arrangement</strong></p><p>Students must assemble in groups of 3-4.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Minimum requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Use Agile Development techniques (e.g. Scrum, Kanban, pair programming)</li><li>Creation of an original design (i.e. created by the group)<ul><li>The application must be responsive</li></ul></li><li>Creation of a Web Application, which should:<ul><li>Make use of a framework that helps creating interactive interfaces such as React</li><li>Make use of multiple APIs (e.g. for authentication, persistence layer, computing, data fetching, etc)</li><li>Count on multiple interaction points</li><li>Count on data persistence</li></ul></li><li>Final product must be available online (no need for a paid domain)</li><li>A battery of user tests must be executed to ensure good UX</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Deliverables</strong></p><ul><li>Link to project briefing</li><li>Link to design files for all pages (include responsiveness)</li><li>Link to style guide</li><li>Link to User Experience tests report</li><li>Link to repository containing the project’s code</li><li>Link to access the project online</li><li>Group presentation about final result</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Theme ideas</strong></p><ul><li>Tinder for cats 🤣</li><li>An app that makes use of Computer Vision API to control something, like playing a game</li><li>An app to help people identify a possible cause for their health condition</li><li>Visualization of the countries’ exports / Some data visualization app</li><li>An app that makes use of Augmented Reality</li><li>An online museum</li><li>A job board</li><li>A trip planner</li><li>A book organizer</li><li>An app to show details of how and where a product was manufactured (e.g. that coffee bag)</li><li>AI Chatbot</li></ul>"}],"project":{"UID":"4-connecting-to-the-world","Title":"4 -
