In modern times it's not only the tool you'll be writing the code in but it's also the ecosystem that will be helping you go through the complex modern development environment, with it's built-in features and plugins. In this Guide you should install and get acquainted the main code editor we'll be using in the course: VSCode.</p><p><strong>Accounts</strong></p><p>As a web developer you will need to have online tools to help on your work. To start with, create an account on Github, Repl.it and Glitch, and read up on them.</p><p>Github hosts code you create with Git, and we will be using it to deliver almost all work to be done throughout the course.</p><p>Both Repl.it and Glitch will allow you to create quick, working prototypes (demos) in HTML, CSS and Javascript and other programming languages.</p><p><strong>Terminal</strong></p><p>The terminal is a software that allows you to run scripts and different kinds of software just by typing their names and some options in a command line. It will prove very useful in your day-to-day life as a web developer.</p><p><strong>Git</strong></p><p>Git is a versioning system that widely used to keep track of different code versions (so that it is clear what changed with each iteration). Github is a company that makes use of this technology to host many Git repositories. Learning Git is paramount when dealing with code both because it organizes the workflow and because it makes it very easy to collaborate and share your work.</p><p><strong>Markdown</strong></p><p>Markdown is a way to write rich text with only a simple editor. It is going to be used in every project in this course to create a README.md file, which should contain relevant information about that work. Markdown can also used to manage the content of &nbsp;websites that don't rely on the use of databases for such.</p>","Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what a code editor is"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what code versioning is"}],"Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to use a code editor (create code files, save them)"},{"Skill":"Be able to install and use supporting tools for the code editor"},{"Skill":"Be able to create quick code prototypes online"},{"Skill":"Be able to use Git for code hosting and versioning"},{"Skill":"Be able to write a document in Markdown format"}],"topicsList":"<ul><li>VSCode<ul><li>Extensions<ul><li>Prettier</li><li>Live Server</li><li>GitLens</li><li>Polacode</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Accounts: <a href=\"https://github.com/\">Github</a>, <a href=\"https://repl.it/\">Repl.it</a> and <a href=\"https://glitch.com/\"><span class=\"ck-fake-link-selection\">Glitch</span></a></li><li>Terminal<ul><li>VSCode Terminal</li></ul></li><li>Git</li><li>Markdown</li></ul>","actionPoints":[{"actionPoint":"Install VSCode"},{"actionPoint":"Add a folder (workspace) to VSCode , then create and save files in it"},{"actionPoint":"Look up and play with some VSCode Extensions (Prettier, Live Server, GitLens, Polacode)"},{"actionPoint":"Create an account on Github, Repl.it and Glitch"}],"Deliver":{"Title":"Nothing","Description":"<p>Every guide has a deliverable attached to it, but this one is an exception.
