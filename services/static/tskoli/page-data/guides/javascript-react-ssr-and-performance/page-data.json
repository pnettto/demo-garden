But there will be times when we want to use its power along with statically generated pages, for performance and SEO reasons, for example. This process is called Server-Side Rendering (SSR), and there are many tools that help you accomplish this task.</p><p>In this Guide you will explore Gatsby, a static page generator for React. Gatsby uses a data layer heavily connected to GraphQL, an up-and-coming technology for data querying, so you'll also learn about that.</p><p>After this, you will go through Progressive Web Apps topics and general performance enhancement techniques.&nbsp;</p>","Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is Server-Side Rendering"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is GraphQL"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a Progressive Web App (PWA)"}],"Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to create a static site with React"},{"Skill":"Be able to use GraphQL to query data"},{"Skill":"Be able to create a Progresssive Web App"},{"Skill":"Be able to run performance checks and act on the results"}],"topicsList":"<ul><li>Gatsby, GraphQL &amp; Apollo</li><li>PWAs / Background jobs &amp; Service Workers</li><li>Google Lighthouse (or similar)</li></ul>","actionPoints":[{"actionPoint":"Study about GatsbyJS"},{"actionPoint":"Create a Gastby demo"},{"actionPoint":"Connect the Gatsby demo to an external data source"},{"actionPoint":"Try Apollo (or similar) to create requests to the API you are using to fetch data"},{"actionPoint":"Transform your Gatsby app into a Progressive Web App"},{"actionPoint":"Make performance audits with Google Lighthouse (or similar)"}],"Deliver":{"Title":"Gatsby application","Description":"<ul><li>Submit:<ul><li>Glitch Project URL or Github Repository + Github Pages URLs</li><li>Project description and details in the README.md file</li></ul></li><li>Minimum requirements:<ul><li>Create a Gatsby website using data from an external resource</li><li>Make use of the in-built GraphQL data layer</li><li>Make sure the application is a PWA (Gatbsy provides support)</li><li>Provide a Google Lighthouse (or similar) audit summary (PDF) and a list of next steps to improve the application’s performance and/or accessibility</li></ul></li><li>Theme ideas:<ul><li>Private books/movies library with search</li><li>Portfolio website</li></ul></li></ul>"},"Classes":[],"Resources":[],"project":{"UID":"5-growing-complexity","Title":"5 - Growing complexity","guides":[{"Title":"Javascript - Internals","UID":"javascript-internals","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to write a technical article"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is the Javascript Event Loops"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is prototypal inheritance in Javascript"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Javascript/React - SPAs","UID":"javascript-react-spas","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to create a SPA with React"},{"Skill":"Be able to use an authentication mechanism in React"},{"Skill":"Be able to use a database in React"},{"Skill":"Be able to use a state management tool"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a Single Page Application"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a Router in Javascript"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is Authentication"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a database"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Javascript/React - SSR & Performance","UID":"javascript-react-ssr-and-performance","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to create a static site with React"},{"Skill":"Be able to use GraphQL to query data"},{"Skill":"Be able to create a Progresssive Web App"},{"Skill":"Be able to run performance checks and act on the results"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is Server-Side Rendering"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is GraphQL"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a Progressive Web App (PWA)"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Javascript Beyond the Browser - Reactive Native","UID":"javascript-beyond-the-browser-reactive-native","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to use React Native to create a mobile app"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a mobile application framework"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is React Native"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Javascript Beyond the Browser - Electron","UID":"javascript-electron","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to create a Desktop application with Javascript"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is ElectronJS"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Design - Web Design Trends","UID":"design-web-design-trends","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to do market research related to web design"}],"Knowledge":[],"Category":"design"}],"product_development":{"UID":"a-complex-web-application","Title":"A Complex Web Application","Competences":[{"Competence":"To be ready to collaborate effectively with peers in order to achieve a common goal"},{"Competence":"To be ready to learn and apply new technologies independently"},{"Competence":"To be ready to exhibit the results of a collaborative work"},{"Competence":"To be ready to create and deliver professional-grade web applications"}]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3604364457","3649515864","63159454"]}
