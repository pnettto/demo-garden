Nevertheless, in the context of front-end development, there is a lot of work done with Javascript that relies on important Networking concepts, and that is why this Guide will help you explore them.</p><p>The Internet is the largest network in the World and is the home of the World Wide Web? But how are these two different? Time to find out :)</p><p>Another important networking aspect is the use of Web Servers. Every app or website you used stores their files and data in such servers, so it's important to understand how they work.</p><p>This Guide's deliverable is a little different from the previous ones in which you should not deliver code, but a technical article. That means you will write and publish a nice text to show a bit of what you understood about the current subject and share it with the online community.</p>","Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand the basics about Internet architecture"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a protocol"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is HTTP and DNS"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a Web Server"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is Cache"},{"Knowledge":"Understand the difference between traditional web hosting and cloud computing"}],"Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to write a technical article"}],"topicsList":"<ul><li>Internet architecture<ul><li>TCP/IP</li><li>HTTP</li><li>DNS</li></ul></li><li>Web Servers<ul><li>What is a Web Server</li><li>Static vs. Dynamic content</li><li>Cache</li><li>Traditional Web Hosting vs. Cloud Computing</li></ul></li></ul>","actionPoints":[{"actionPoint":"Take on a \"How the internet works\" short course/class"},{"actionPoint":"Make sure to understand what DNS and HTTP are"},{"actionPoint":"Learn what is a Web Server and what are some examples"},{"actionPoint":"Learn what is cache"},{"actionPoint":"Learn the differences between cloud computing and traditional hosting"}],"Deliver":{"Title":"Technical Article","Description":"<ul><li>Submit:<ul><li>Article’s public URL</li></ul></li><li>Minimum requirements:&nbsp;<ul><li>Technical article about Networking &amp;
