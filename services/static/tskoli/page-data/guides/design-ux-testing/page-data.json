But it shouldn't be where it ends because, as it turns out, humans are extremely unpredictable. To counter that, it's necessary to test with the users themselves. There are several tools to help you organize this work, and that's what you'll be exploring in this Guide.</p>","Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is UX Testing"}],"Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to create a simple UX testing plan"}],"topicsList":"<ul><li>Quantitative / Qualitative</li><li>User Personas / User Journey Mapping</li><li>A/B Testing</li></ul>","actionPoints":[{"actionPoint":"Read-up on UX Testing"},{"actionPoint":"Find out what is the difference between quantitative and qualitative UX tests"},{"actionPoint":"Learn how to use User Personas and User Journey Mapping"},{"actionPoint":"Learn what is A/B testing in UX"},{"actionPoint":"Create an UX testing plan for a project"}],"Deliver":{"Title":"Article with research results","Description":"<ul><li>Submit:<ul><li>Article’s public URL</li></ul></li><li>Minimum requirements:&nbsp;<ul><li>Perform the appropriate testing techniques from a UX point of view for a Web Design project</li><li>Write an article to present the data collected and conclusions taken<ul><li>Make sure to add a few graphics to illustrate the results</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>"},"Classes":[],"Resources":[],"project":{"UID":"4-connecting-to-the-world","Title":"4 - Connecting to the World","guides":[{"Title":"Javascript - Networking & Internet Basics","UID":"javascript-networking-and-internet-basics","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to write a technical article"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand the basics about Internet architecture"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a protocol"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is HTTP and DNS"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a Web Server"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is Cache"},{"Knowledge":"Understand the difference between traditional web hosting and cloud computing"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Javascript - API Consumption","UID":"javascript-api-consumption","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to use JSON to transport data across different systems"},{"Skill":"Be able to use the fetch API in Javascript"},{"Skill":"Be able to use Promises in Javascript"},{"Skill":"Be able to use Async functions in Javascript"},{"Skill":"Be able to debug Javascript code using both the console and VSCode (or similar)"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is JSON"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is the client-server architecture"},{"Knowledge":"Understand the concept of Promises"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Javascript - Functional programming","UID":"javascript-functional-programming","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to create code using the Functional programming paradigm"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a programming paradigm"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is Functional programming"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is Object-oriented programming"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what are pure functions"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Javascript - Modules, Package Managers and Bundlers","UID":"javascript-modules-package-managers-and-bundlers","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to use a package manager such as npm"},{"Skill":"Be able to bundle a code base"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a package manager"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what a dependency is"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what a bundler is"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Javascript - Testing & Error prevention","UID":"javascript-testing-and-error-prevention","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to create test units for Javascript code"},{"Skill":"Be able to use Typescript"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is Test-drive Development (TDD)"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Javascript/React - Fundamentals","UID":"javascript-react-fundamentals","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to create a React application"},{"Skill":"Be able to use state management in React"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a Javascript Framework"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is React"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is JSX"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is State Management"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a side-effect"}],"Category":"code"},{"Title":"Design/UX - Testing","UID":"design-ux-testing","Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to create a simple UX testing plan"}],"Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is UX Testing"}],"Category":"design"}],"product_development":{"UID":"a-web-application-which-focuses-on-connectivity-and-interactivity","Title":"A web application which focuses on connectivity and interactivity","Competences":[{"Competence":"To be ready to collaborate effectively with peers in order to achieve a common goal"},{"Competence":"To be ready to learn and apply new technologies independently"},{"Competence":"To be ready to exhibit the results of a collaborative work"},{"Competence":"To be ready to create and deliver rich web applications"}]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3604364457","3649515864","63159454"]}
