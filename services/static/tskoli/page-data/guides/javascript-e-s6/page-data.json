That is not a reason not to use it, though. There is a mechanism called transpilation, which allows us to transform ES6 code into an older format which browsers do understand. With that said, this Guide will help you understand better what is new in the ES6 “version” and why is it better.</p>","Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is ES6"},{"Knowledge":"Understand the concept of transpilation"}],"Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to make use of ES6 features"},{"Skill":"Be able to transpile ES6 code"}],"topicsList":"<ul><li>ES6 Overview<ul><li>What is it and what's new?</li><li>Browser compatibility</li><li>Transpilation with Babel</li></ul></li></ul>","actionPoints":[{"actionPoint":"Read up on ES6 to find out what is \"new\""},{"actionPoint":"Learn how to transpile ES6 code with Babel"},{"actionPoint":"Find out what is ECMA2015"}],"Deliver":{"Title":"Exercise solution","Description":"<ul><li>Submit:&nbsp;<ul><li>Repl.it Project URL (<a href=\"https://repl.it/languages/javascript\">Javascript Repl</a>)</li><li>Add comments for each relevant code block</li></ul></li><li>Description:<ul><li>Adapt the result of the Contact List exercise (<a href=\"/guides/javascript-functions\"><span class=\"ck-fake-link-selection\">Guide “Javascript- Functions\"</span></a>) to use ES6 features, containing:<ul><li>Arrow functions</li><li>let/const</li><li>Template literals</li><li>Object destructuring / Spread operator</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>"},"Classes":[],"Resources":[{"Description":"JS fundamentals tutorials","Link":"https://www.w3schools.com/js "},{"Description":"JS fundamentals exercises","Link":"https://www.w3schools.com/js/exercise_js.asp"},{"Description":"JS Cheat Sheet","Link":"https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/create-video-games-with-phaser/tracks/game-dev-learn-javascript-basics/modules/game-dev-learn-javascript-basics/cheatsheet"},{"Description":"Javascript JS Handbook by Flavio Copes","Link":"https://flaviocopes.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/js-handbook/js-handbook.pdf "},{"Description":"Javascript Beginner Handbook by Flavio Copes","Link":"https://flaviocopes.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/javascript-beginner-handbook/javascript-beginner-handbook.pdf"}],"project":{"UID":"3-the-fundamentals","Title":"3 -
