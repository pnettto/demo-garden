These are <strong>languages</strong> allow us to tell the browser what to show, how it will look like and how each part should behave.</p><p>HTML defines <strong>what </strong>should be shown on the screen and in which hierarchy, like a paragraph, a list containing a dozen items, an image, etc.</p><p>CSS defines <strong>how things look like</strong>.<strong> </strong>For example, if the color of a text should be purple or if an element should be always in the top right corner.</p><p>Javascript defines <strong>how things should behave</strong>. For example, if a message should appear if I click a button, or if more images should be loaded as the user approaches the end of an image list.</p><p>These three technologies alone compose the basis of almost all of the work we will go through in this course, and therefore should be well studied, understood and mastered.</p><p>By far, Javascript is the most complex and powerful of the three, so we will be spending more time learning it.</p><p>Many other powerful tools you will study and use were created with these three technologies, which expose how simplicity can give way to a complex and vibrant ecosystem as the web development community.</p>","Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what HTML, CSS and Javascript are"}],"Skills":[],"topicsList":"<ul><li>HTML</li><li>CSS</li><li>Javascript</li></ul>","actionPoints":[{"actionPoint":"Read up on HTML, CSS and Javascript to understand the concepts"}],"Deliver":{"Title":"Nothing","Description":"<p>Every guide has a deliverable attached to it, but this one is an exception.
