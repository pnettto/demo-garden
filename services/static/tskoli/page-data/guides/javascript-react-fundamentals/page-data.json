Granted, the landscape of popular frameworks changes by the week, so it is likely that React (and all the others) will be replaced with newer, shinier options in the future. But that does not mean we shouldn't spend time learning these tools.&nbsp;</p><p>First, because they will indeed improve our productivity. Second, because they will increase your chances of getting work you want. And third because learning a new framework is not only about learning tha framework itself, but also about the process of learning a new Javascript tool and related concepts, which is the single most important ability you will develop in this course.</p><p>In this Guide you will explore the fundamental aspects of React.</p>","Knowledge":[{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a Javascript Framework"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is React"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is JSX"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is State Management"},{"Knowledge":"Understand what is a side-effect"}],"Skills":[{"Skill":"Be able to create a React application"},{"Skill":"Be able to use state management in React"}],"topicsList":"<ul><li>React setup</li><li>JSX</li><li>Functional Components<ul><li>Functional Components vs Class Components</li></ul></li><li>Styled Components &amp; CSS Modules</li><li>State<ul><li>State control with Forms</li></ul></li><li>Effects</li></ul>","actionPoints":[{"actionPoint":"Take on a React Crash Course"},{"actionPoint":"Learn what are the differences between Functional and Class-based components"},{"actionPoint":"Discover how to use Styled Components (or similar) in React"},{"actionPoint":"Read up on Side effects in Javascript"},{"actionPoint":"Find out how to use the state and effect Hooks"}],"Deliver":{"Title":"Interactive React App","Description":"<ul><li>Submit:<ul><li>Glitch Project URL or Github Repository + Github Pages URLs</li><li>Project description and details in the README.md file</li></ul></li><li>Minimum requirements:<ul><li>Create a React application that allows the user to interact by modifying state data<ul><li>Use State Hooks</li></ul></li><li>Use API to fetch information from a public API and use it in the application<ul><li>Use Effect Hooks</li><li>Possible to use your own API created at <a href=\"https://www.mockaroo.com/\">https://www.mockaroo.com/</a> or <a href=\"https://airtable.com/\">https://airtable.com/</a></li></ul></li><li>Make use of Styled Components or CSS Modules to style the application</li></ul></li><li>Theme ideas:<ul><li>Memory game</li><li>(Random?)
