These <strong>Subjects</strong> are comprised of:</p><ol><li>A <strong>Description</strong></li><li>A set of <strong>Resources</strong> (e.g. books, articles, tutorials, and videos references)</li><li>One or more <strong>Deliverables</strong>, which represent the construction of that knowledge by the student (e.g. the creation of a working demo or an article about that <strong>Subject</strong>)</li></ol><p>The <strong>Research Modules</strong> can be explored in a non-linear manner, depending on the student’s personal interests. This process does not have to be restricted to the listed topics, the student is encouraged to expand on it and create experiments related to their personal interests.</p><p>The assessment of the <strong>Research Modules</strong> is made through a two-step process:</p><ol><li>Peer assessment<br>Each deliverable must be reviewed by classroom colleagues, who need to look at the resultant work and emit constructive criticism, followed by a “pass” or “no pass” vote. If enough “pass” votes are given, the deliverable is considered to be done. Otherwise the student needs to review the work and submit it again for peer review.</li><li>Giving feedback<br>Every student is required to review their peers’ work in each <strong>Project</strong>. This feedback is given by analysing a submitted work, giving written constructive criticism and a “pass” or “no pass” vote.&nbsp;<br><br>This process does not have to be done in a linear fashion and points are accumulated with each feedback given, which is how they compose part of the <strong>Project</strong>’s final grade. Note that the feedback itself is given a subjective “quality measure” by the receiver, which affects its worth and value.</li></ol><p>Please refer to the <strong>Grading</strong> section for further information on metrics.</p><h3>Collaborative Product Development</h3><p>Once the <strong>Research Modules</strong> have been assessed and passed the students can proceed to communicate with their peers and assemble a team in order to take on the <strong>Product Development</strong> phase, which consists of a <strong>Framework</strong> describing a line of work and within which the team has freedom to create anything they wish, according to the group’s interests.&nbsp;</p><p>The <strong>Framework</strong> usually contains elements of project management, design and coding, meaning that the team needs to be assembled in such a way that all skills necessary to accomplish the task are available within the group. Note that this means having to wait for some time until a team is ready to work on the <strong>Product</strong>. If such a wait happens the student can go ahead and start on other <strong>Research Modules</strong> or <strong>Product Developments</strong>.</p><p>The group is expected to self-organize in order to manage the whole process, making use of project management tools and techniques learned in previous <strong>Workshops</strong> (such as the ones available in the introductory <strong>Project</strong>) as a way to ensure good productivity.</p><p>The <strong>Product Development</strong> phase must be, for the most part, a collaborative endeavour, but in specific cases, when conditions for such are not met, an individual approach can be given, being <strong>2 turns</strong> the limit for these cases in the whole length of the course.</p><p>The assessment of the <strong>Product Development</strong> is made by a small group of industry professionals (often from management, design and programming background), to which a presentation (containing a demo component) of the project must be done. Please refer to the <strong>Grading</strong> section for further information on metrics.</p><h3>Retrospective meeting</h3><p>Upon completion of the <strong>Project</strong> the group takes on a Retrospective meeting to evaluate the whole process and identify the positive aspects or the process as well as the ones in which they can improve during the next <strong>Project</strong>.</p><h3>Portfolio</h3><p>Once the <strong>Project</strong> is done, each student should add the resulting product to their portfolio (personal website or social media profile such as Dribbble or Behance), which should contain multiple projects by the end of the course.</p><h3>Exceptions</h3><p>There are notable exceptions to this <strong>Project</strong> structure:</p><ul><li>On <strong>Project 2</strong> the student is asked to use a certain amount of hours in different activities that can help in his/her integration in the web development community, which does not involve necessarily doing specific research or following a framework for the creation of a product.</li><li>On <strong>Project 7</strong> the student is free to explore the trends in the fringes of web technologies and create a product with the selected topic, not necessarily following specific guidelines.</li></ul><p><strong>Project 8</strong></p><p>&nbsp;is composed of an Internship</p>"}]},{"UID":"grading","Title":"Grading","featuredImage":null,"Content":[{"__typename":"Strapi_ComponentPageContentComponentsText2","Text":"<h3>Regular Projects</h3><p>The structure and metrics of the grading for each <strong>Project</strong> is described below and the possible grades for each item are indicated using <i>[square brackets and italics]</i>.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Design Research Modules</strong> &amp; <strong>Coding Research Modules</strong> <i>[0 to 10, each]</i><ul><li>Design and Codings Research Modules are assessed separately but follow the same structure, described as follows</li><li>Each <strong>Research Subject</strong> needs to correspond to a <strong>Subject Assessment Application (SAA)</strong>, which in turn needs to receive 1 positive feedback (“pass” vote) from a peer to be considered “done”</li><li>In case a <strong>SAA</strong> gets a negative feedback (“no pass” vote), the related <strong>Subject</strong> requires a revision and the submission of a new <strong>SAA</strong>.<ul><li>While correcting a <strong>SAA</strong> the evaluator should halt as soon as a breaking/careless mistake is found and return it with a “no pass” vote</li></ul></li><li>Each student must correct at least 1 <strong>SAA</strong> per <strong>Subject</strong></li><li>In order to be able to correct a <strong>SAA</strong> a student needs to have handed in an application for that same subject beforehand</li><li>If necessary an Instructor can evaluate <strong>SAAs</strong> (e.g. if it takes too long for a student to be able to do so)</li><li>The grade for each <strong>Research Module</strong> consists of the average of the following topics:<ul><li>60% - Pass votes <i>[0 or 10]</i></li><li>30% - Average of the grade given for “quality of feedbacks” made <i>[0 to 10]</i><ul><li>Each feedback can be assessed as Not useful (0), Useful (6) and Very useful (10)</li></ul></li><li>10% - Completion of all necessary feedbacks (1 per <strong>Subject</strong>) <i>[0 or 10]</i></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Product Development</strong></li><li>This grade consists of the average of the following topics <i>[0 to 10]</i><ul><li>10% - Delivery to Inna of all related files via Github or similar digital mean <i>[0 or 10]</i></li><li>65% - Average of grades given by a group of industry professionals, related to the presentation and demonstration of the finished <strong>Product</strong> <i>[0 to 10]</i></li><li>25% - Jafningjamat is a way that the group’s members can assess each other’s participation during the work.
